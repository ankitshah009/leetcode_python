#223. Rectangle Area
#Medium
#
#Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the
#total area covered by the two rectangles.
#
#The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its
#top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
#
#The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its
#top-right corner (bx2, by2).
#
#Example 1:
#Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
#Output: 45
#
#Example 2:
#Input: ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2
#Output: 16
#
#Constraints:
#    -10^4 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 10^4
#    -10^4 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 10^4
#    -10^4 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 10^4
#    -10^4 <= by1 <= by2 <= 10^4
