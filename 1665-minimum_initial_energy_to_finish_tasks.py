#1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks
#Hard
#
#You are given an array tasks where tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]:
#
#    actuali is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the ith task.
#    minimumi is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the ith task.
#
#For example, if the task is [10, 12] and your current energy is 11, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is 13, you can complete this task, and your energy will be 3 after finishing it.
#
#You can finish the tasks in any order you like.
#
#Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.
#
# 
#
#Example 1:
#
#Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]
#Output: 8
#Explanation:
#Starting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
#    - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.
#    - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.
#    - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.
#Notice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.
#
#Example 2:
#
#Input: tasks = [[1,3],[2,4],[10,11],[10,12],[8,9]]
#Output: 32
#Explanation:
#Starting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
#    - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.
#    - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.
#    - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.
#    - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.
#    - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.
#
#Example 3:
#
#Input: tasks = [[1,7],[2,8],[3,9],[4,10],[5,11],[6,12]]
#Output: 27
#Explanation:
#Starting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
#    - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.
#    - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.
#    - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.
#    - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.
#    - 4th task. Now energy = 16 - 4 = 12.
#    - 6th task. Now energy = 12 - 6 = 6.
#
# 

#Constraints:
#
#    1 <= tasks.length <= 105
#    1 <= actualâ€‹i <= minimumi <= 104

#Approach #1 - Binary Search
#
#    Sort by difference
#    Use binary search validate if given input (energy) can finish all works
#    Search the smallest possible (like bisect_left)
