#443. String Compression
#Medium
#
#Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
#
#Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
#    If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
#    Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
#
#The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the
#input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split
#into multiple characters in chars.
#
#After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
#
#You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
#Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
#
#Example 2:
#Input: chars = ["a"]
#Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
#
#Example 3:
#Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
#Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
#
#Constraints:
#    1 <= chars.length <= 2000
#    chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write = 0
        read = 0

        while read < len(chars):
            char = chars[read]
            count = 0

            # Count consecutive characters
            while read < len(chars) and chars[read] == char:
                read += 1
                count += 1

            # Write character
            chars[write] = char
            write += 1

            # Write count if > 1
            if count > 1:
                for digit in str(count):
                    chars[write] = digit
                    write += 1

        return write
