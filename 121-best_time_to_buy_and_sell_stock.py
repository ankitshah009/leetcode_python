#121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
#Easy
#
#You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
#
#You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a
#different day in the future to sell that stock.
#
#Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any
#profit, return 0.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
#Output: 5
#Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
#
#Example 2:
#Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
#Output: 0
#Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
#
#Constraints:
#    1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
#    0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)

        return max_profit
