#657. Robot Return to Origin
#Easy
#
#There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane.
#Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it
#completes its moves.
#
#You are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot
#where moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are 'R' (right), 'L' (left),
#'U' (up), and 'D' (down).
#
#Return true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its
#moves, or false otherwise.
#
#Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. 'R' will always make
#the robot move to the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc.
#Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: moves = "UD"
#Output: true
#
#Example 2:
#Input: moves = "LL"
#Output: false
#
#Constraints:
#    1 <= moves.length <= 2 * 10^4
#    moves only contains the characters 'U', 'D', 'L' and 'R'.
