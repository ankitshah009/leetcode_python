#463. Island Perimeter
#Easy
#
#You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and
#grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
#
#Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely
#surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
#
#The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around
#the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height
#don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
#Output: 16
#
#Example 2:
#Input: grid = [[1]]
#Output: 4
#
#Example 3:
#Input: grid = [[1,0]]
#Output: 4
#
#Constraints:
#    row == grid.length
#    col == grid[i].length
#    1 <= row, col <= 100
#    grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
#    There is exactly one island in grid.

class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        perimeter = 0

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    # Start with 4 sides
                    perimeter += 4

                    # Subtract shared edges with neighbors
                    if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2
                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2

        return perimeter
