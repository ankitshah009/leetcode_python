#1631. Path With Minimum Effort
#Medium
#
#You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size
#rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are
#situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell,
#(rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish
#to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
#
#A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive
#cells of the route.
#
#Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
#Output: 2
#Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
#This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
#
#Example 2:
#Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
#Output: 1
#Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells,
#which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
#
#Example 3:
#Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
#Output: 0
#Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
#
#Constraints:
#    rows == heights.length
#    columns == heights[i].length
#    1 <= rows, columns <= 100
#    1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
